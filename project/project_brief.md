# Mini-Project - Shop Landing Page
## Welcome
This is your BNTA assessment day mini-project.

Challenges such as this one are created to help improve your coding ability and understanding by building realistic projects.

To complete this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

There is an extension task which requires the use of JavaScript.

### The Challenge
Your challenge is to **build out a shop landing page** which can be anything from a snacks or record shop to whatever excites you. You'll use the designs, code examples and what you've learned so far to guide you through the processâ€”but don't be afraid to google things along the way that you don't understand. Software development varies so much between languages and product versions so being able to find the information you are looking for efficiently, is an important skill.

### Project Aims
Your **Minimum Viable Product** is to:

- create a webpage for viewing within a fullscreen desktop window using HTML & CSS

You could also create a stretch goal or two. Something along the lines of:

- Implement a Dark Mode button using HTML and JavaScript
- create and link to multiple pages

### Teams
Each student will be placed into a group of 4â€”5 people. It is between yourselves how you organise your time. We are looking as much for great teamwork as we are for individual contribution so please do support your teammates where you can!

To collaborate we advise using Live Share, an extension to VSCode. If you haven't installed Live Share already, don't worry. When you open VSCode you should see a panel on the left-hand side of your screen. Click the icon that looks like four little cubes (you can hover your mouse over the icon and it should say "Extensions"). In the search bar type 'live share' and install Live Share by Microsoft.

Important note: Once you install Live Share, restart VSCode as the plugin will only work once you have done so

Another Visual Studio Code extension you may find useful is Live Server. This extension is used to allow the Live Share host to share their local server with all of the collaboratorsâ€”allowing all workers to view the HTML webpage in the browser as if stored locally. For a short introduction to Live Server and how to set-up hot browser reloading (reloading upon saving of code), please watch this short 3 min video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4qqQeUDCBQ

### Support
Want some support on the challenge? Trainers are on-hand to support you but we advise you follow the process of Brain, Book, Buddy, Boss (in this case trainer) so that you first attempt to solve the problem yourself or as a team. Try to help each other and if you're still stuck, a trainer will be available to help.


### Useful Resources
- **W3schools** - W3Schools is best used as a reference for HTML, CSS and JavaScript when searching for syntax and basic explanations of functionality.
- **MDN Web Docs** - The MDN Web Docs site provides information about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You may find that the MDN explanations go into great depth, explaining functionality at a more base-level. 
- **Trello** - useful project management tool. Alternatively, a simple shared Google doc can be very effective.
- **Google Slides** - for working collaboratively on your presentation
- **Coolors** - `coolors.co` excellent for picking colour palettes


## Preparing For Your Presentation

- **Presentation Start Time**: 2:00pm (please come to the main space at 1.55pm)
- **Presentation Duration**: 10 minutes per group (7 minute presentation, 3 minutes for questions)

Please don't go over 7 minutes for your presentation.

Typically, only one person screen shares throughout.

Every person in the group should take a turn speaking.

Have fun building! ðŸš€
